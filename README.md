# Decision Making Statements
Experiment 5

## AIM
To use decision making If-else.

## Theory
Decision-making is a concept that allows the execution of different code paths based on conditions. The if and else statements are primary constructs used for decision-making in  C++. These constructs enable the implementation of conditional logic. They help us check whether a condition is true and if it is, then the block inside the same is executed.  
example:
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

}
```
## Algorithm
### To Check the Quadrants

1. **Start**

2. **Initialize**:
   - Declare two integer variables `x` and `y`.

3. **Input**:
   - Ask the user to enter the X-axis coordinate and store it in `x`.
   - Ask the user to enter the Y-axis coordinate and store it in `y`.

4. **Decision Making** (using if-else statements):
   - **If** `x > 0` and `y > 0`:
     - Print "The point is in the first quadrant."
   - **Else If** `x < 0` and `y > 0`:
     - Print "The point is in the second quadrant."
   - **Else If** `x < 0` and `y < 0`:
     - Print "The point is in the third quadrant."
   - **Else If** `x > 0` and `y < 0`:
     - Print "The point is in the fourth quadrant."
   - **Else If** `(x == 0` and `y != 0)` **or** `(x != 0` and `y == 0)`:
     - Print "The point is on the axis."
   - **Else**:
     - Print "The point is at the origin."

### Positive and Negative

1. **Start**

2. **Initialize**:
   - Declare a float variable `num`.

3. **Input**:
   - Ask the user to enter a number and store it in `num`.

4. **Decision Making** (using if-else statements):
   - **If** `num > 0`:
     - Print "The num is POSITIVE."
   - **Else**:
     - Print "The num is NEGATIVE."

5. **End**

### Vowel and Consonant Checker

1. **Start**

2. **Initialize**:
   - Declare a `char` variable `character`.

3. **Input**:
   - Ask the user to enter a character and store it in `a`.

4. **Decision Making** (using if-else statements):
   - **If** `character` is one of the following vowels (both lowercase and uppercase):
     - `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, `'A'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`:
     - Print "`character` is a vowel."
   - **Else**:
     - Print "`character` is a consonant."

5. **End**
